Introduction
============

HAYSTAC is a comprehensive computational tool for identifying species from DNA sequence data. It can pre-process sequencing data (adapter trimming), build a database, analyse sequencing data and perform a deamination profile analysis. It can work in two different modes. One mode performs metagenomic identifications from samples containing multiple organisms, and outputs mean posterior species abundances. The second mode can perform species identifications from single organism samples and it outputs species assignment posterior probabilities.
